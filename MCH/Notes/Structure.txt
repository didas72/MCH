MCH structure

User creates several "Mods" containing
	"SpawnGroups"
	"Prefabs"
	"ContainerTypes"
	"Factions"
	"Behaviours"
	"Encounters" ? (which have prefabs, behaviours (again) and triggers)

SpawnGroups have:
	Id
		TypeId = (always "SpawnGroupDefinition")
		SubtypeId = name
	Description
		[MES TAGS]
	IsPriate (always "true")
	Frequency = freq
	Prefabs
		Prefab <SubtypeId=prefabName>
			Position
				X = x
				Y = y
				Z = z
		Speed = speed
		Behaviour = (behaviour)
