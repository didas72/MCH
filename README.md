# MES Configuration Helper

[Modular Encounters Systems](https://github.com/MeridiusIX/Modular-Encounters-Systems) is a framework and mod for
Space Engineers developed by [MeridiusIX](https://github.com/MeridiusIX) that allows easy creation of NPC mods.
MCH aims to be (as implied in the name) a helper tool to develop such mods.

MES requires the modder to provide `.sbc` files which hold information relative to their grids. These XML structured
files can look scary for the inexperienced user so MCH tries to abstract most of that away and provide a user
friendly GUI.
